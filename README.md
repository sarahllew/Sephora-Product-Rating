Take a look at my final project: https://sarahllew.github.io/Predicting_Sephora_ML.html

Predicting the `rating` of a product on the Sephora online store using machine learning models in R.

Performed visual EDA and analyzed relationship of variables that impact online ratings. 

Trained machine learning models: KNN, linear regression, elastic net, decision tree, random forest, boosted trees.

Tested best performing machine learning model on Kaggle dataset to predict product `rating` for over 2000 products.
